### About me :snake:

Hi, my name is Katherine. I am a full stack developer looking for my first job in tech. My strongest language is Python; I've been focussing on advancing my knowledge, skills and coding quality here in an effort to build overall programming expertise that I can transfer to other languages also. I'm also well experienced in SQL, JavaScript, and React.js. At the end of 2023 I completed the 16 week intensive CFG degree specialising in Full Stack. I like implementing features across the whole stack but backend and data handling is my favourite.

### Skills and interests :bug:
- Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Flask-RESTX
- JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS
- SQL, MySQL, SQLite
- Unit/integration testing
- Building REST APIs
- Full stack and backend development

### Learning/improving 🌱
- C language fundamentals
- Django
- Kivy and frontend Flask/Django
- Testing in React
- TypeScript
- Node and Express
- MongoDB

### Courses :books:
- I’m currently working through Harvard’s famous CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science, to further develop my knowledge of computer science fundamentals. It’s been really fun and useful so far learning about C, memory, and data structures from the ground up.
- I’m also going through Udemy’s Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures and Algorithms, while tackling Leetcode 75 as well.

### Projects :rocket:
- Lead backend developer for [IntroVerse](https://github.com/Angel2001-programmer/Introverse) (React.js/Python), a safe haven for introverts who love reading, anime, and games
- Working on a Kickboxing moves android app (Python with Kivy GUI)
- I’m open collaborate on any projects I can help with, Python, Flask and SQL are the main areas I am currently strongest in

### My story :european_castle:
At university I did a BEng and PhD in Materials Science and Engineering. I've got 9 years of postdoctoral research experience in solar cells and thermochemical heat storage. Last March I decided I wanted a change, something still very analytical and logical but whilst being able to explore my creative side more and still make cool things. I started learning Python and quickly discovered how much I enjoyed coding, wanting to explore deeper into this world and find out what was right for me. I did several courses on Python, SQL, and a few other topics, through LinkedIn Learning, Swansea MAD, and Code First Girls. I applied for the Autumn 2023 cohort of Code First Girl's CFG degree and I was lucky enough to be accepted (sponsored by Admiral). This ran from September to December 2023 and has been amazing, I couldn't have learned more (really, nearly every day my brain was full). I am so glad that I started to learn because I've been missing out all these years. I really can't wait to start my first developer role and demonstrate my hard work and determination.
