### About me

Hi, my name is Katherine. I am a career switcher looking for my first job in tech. My primary language is Python, I love Python. I'm also well experienced in SQL, JavaScript, and React.js. I've just recently completed the 16 week intensive CFG degree specialising in Full Stack. I like implementing features across the whole stack but backend and data is my favourite.

### My story
At university I did a BEng and PhD in Materials Science and Engineering. I've got 9 years of postdoctoral research experience in solar cells and thermochemical heat storage. Last March I decided I wanted a change, something still very analytical and logical but whilst being able to explore my creative side more and still make cool things. I started learning Python and quickly discovered how much I enjoyed coding, wanting to explore deeper into this world and find out what was right for me. I did several courses on Python, SQL, and a few other topics, through LinkedIn Learning, Swansea MAD, and Code First Girls. I applied for the Autumn 2023 cohort of Code First Girl's CFG degree and I was lucky enough to be accepted (sponsored by Admiral). This ran from September to December 2023 and has been amazing, I couldn't have learned more (really, nearly every day my brain was full). I am so glad that I started to learn because I've been missing out all these years. I really can't wait to start my first developer role and demonstrate my hard work and determination.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Kickboxing moves android app (Python with Kivy GUI), and collaborating on IntroVerse (React.js/Python), a safe haven for introverts who love reading, anime, and games, as the lead backend developer
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Django, Kivy, and advancing my Python knowledge
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any projects I can help with, Python, Flask and SQL are the main areas I am currently strongest in

### Courses
- Iâ€™m currently working through Harvardâ€™s famous CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science, to further develop my knowledge of computer science fundamentals. Itâ€™s been really fun and useful so far learning about C, memory, and data structures from the ground up.
- Iâ€™m also going through Udemyâ€™s Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures and Algorithms, while tackling Leetcode 75 as well.
