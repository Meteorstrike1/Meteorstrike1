### About me :snake:
Hi, my name is Katherine. I'm a self taught developer based in Swansea; I've been working as a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) at the DVLA since June 2024. I love making things and quality engineering. I currently specialise in Ruby, developing functional tests, and continuous integration. My background has been in Python and Flask/SQL with a bit of JavaScript and React. I'm super curious and always learning and working to improve my programming expertise.

- Other types of testing

### Career change story :european_castle:
At university I did a BEng and PhD in Materials Science and Engineering. I worked for nearly 9 years as a postdoctoral researcher, focussing on the scale up of renewable technologies such as solar cells. In March 2023 I decided I wanted a change, something still analytical and logical but whilst being able to explore my creative side more and still make cool things. I started learning Python and quickly discovered how much I enjoyed coding; I wanted to explore this world more deeply and find out what was right for me. I did several courses on Python, SQL, and a few other topics, through LinkedIn Learning, Swansea MAD, and Code First Girls. I applied for the Autumn 2023 cohort of Code First Girl's CFG degree and I was lucky enough to be accepted. This ran from September to December 2023 and was an amazing opportunity, it greatly accelerated my learning and gave me a taster of what working as a developer entails. I worked very hard to continue with my learning; improving projects, working on new ones, and embracing testing, while applying to jobs. Eventually this paid off and I started my new career as a developer specialising in test, the best of both worlds.

### Projects :rocket:
- Working on a [Kickboxing](https://github.com/Meteorstrike1/kbmovesapp) moves app (Kivy GUI/Python/Sqlite) which is cross platform and then hoping to deploy to android
- Backend developer for [IntroVerse](https://github.com/Angel2001-programmer/Introverse) (React.js/Python/MySQL), a safe haven for introverts who love reading, anime, and games
